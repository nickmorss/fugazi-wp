Lets you insert custom fields in the visual editor without coding in PHP.

== Description ==

[Custom Fields Shortcodes](http://wp-types.com/home/custom-fields-shortcodes/) lets you insert custom fields that you created using **Advanced Custom Fields**, **Custom Field Template** and **More Fields** or manually, into the WordPress visual editor. You'll get a new popup, next to the media buttons. There, you can select which custom fields to insert, anywhere in the content.

You will see the custom fields that you've defined, neatly arranged by meta-boxes. Choose the field to insert and you'll get its shortcode. You can insert custom fields from either Visual or HTML editing modes.

When inserting custom fields that were created by other plugins, they display using the plugin's API. For instance, if you use 'Advanced Custom Fields' and you insert a 'radio' field, you get the current value. If you insert a WYSIWYG field, you get the full HTML content.

This allows inserting custom fields to your content without having to read them using PHP.

= Adding Custom Fields to WordPress Templates =

Custom Fields Shortcodes integrates seamlessly with [Views](http://wp-types.com/home/views-create-elegant-displays-for-your-content/). You will be able to create [dynamic templates](http://wp-types.com/documentation/user-guides/view-templates/) that include any field you want. Then, apply these templates to different content types, right from within the WordPress GUI.

== Installation ==

1. Upload to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin define custom fields? =

No. There are other great plugins that define custom fields. This plugin lets you add them to your content, without PHP coding.

= If I use Types, do I need this plugin too? =

No. [Types](http://wp-types.com/home/types-manage-post-types-taxonomy-and-custom-fields/) already includes this functionality. Any custom field that you define with Types already appears in the T icon, ready for inserting to content.

Adds shortcode for including a custom field on a page or post.

== Description ==
Adds shortcode for including a custom field on a page or post.
Create a custom field on your post/page. Then use the following shortcode to include it on your site:

[embed_custom_field "field-name-here"]

This is useful for arbitrary bits of text or code that you don't want the WYSIWYG editor to mangle and reformat.

This may work fine with versions older than 3.9.0 (and almost certainly does) but it has not been tested.

== Installation ==
Upload the plugin folder named embed-custom-field in to your plugins directory, or install directly from wordpress.org
